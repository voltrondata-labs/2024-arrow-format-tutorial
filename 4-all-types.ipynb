    "\n",
    "In case the system or application needs to extend standard Arrow data types with custom semantics this is enabled by defining **extension types** or **user-defined** types.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Universally unique identifier (`uuid`) can be represented as a `FixedSizeBinary` type\n",
    "* Trading time can be represented as a `Timestamp` with metadata indicating the market trading calendar\n",
    "\n",
    "Extension types can be defined by annotating any of the built-in Arrow logical types (the “storage type”) with a **custom type name** and **optional serialized representation** (`'ARROW:extension:name'` and `'ARROW:extension:metadata'` keys in the `Field` metadata structure).\n",
